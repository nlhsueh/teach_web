## init project

```
npm init vue@latest
```
Will generate the project folders and files.


### 1. **`public` Folder**
   - **Purpose**: The `public` folder is where you place static assets that should not be processed by the build tool (Vite). These assets are served directly without any transformations.
   - **Contents**:
     - `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your Vue app. During the build process, Vite injects the script and link tags needed for your app.
     - Other assets: Any other files (like images, icons, etc.) that you place in the `public` folder will be copied as-is to the final build output.

### 2. **`jsconfig.json`**
   - **Purpose**: This file is used to configure JavaScript (or TypeScript) settings within your project, particularly for editor tooling. It helps with features like path aliases, IntelliSense, and auto-completions in VSCode or similar editors.
   - **Contents**:
     - `"compilerOptions"`: Configures various options like module resolution, base URL, and paths for your project.
       - `"@/*": ["./src/*"]`: This line creates a path alias, where @/ maps to the ./src/ directory.
       - For example, instead of writing import MyComponent from '../../components/MyComponent.vue', you can write import MyComponent from '@/components/MyComponent.vue'.
     - `"include"`: Specifies the files or directories to be included in the project for type checking and IntelliSense.
     - `exclude`: The exclude option specifies files and directories that should be excluded from type checking, IntelliSense, and other editor tooling.

### 3. **`package.json`**
   - **Purpose**: This is the core configuration file for your project’s dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It defines the dependencies your project needs, the scripts you can run, and other metadata like the project name, version, and author.
   - **Key Sections**:
     - `"dependencies"`: Lists the packages required for your app to run.
     - `"devDependencies"`: Lists the packages required only during development (like Vite, linters, etc.).
     - `"scripts"`: Defines commands you can run using `npm run <script-name>`. Common scripts include `dev` (to start the development server), `build` (to create a production build), and `serve` (to serve the production build locally).

### 4. **`vite.config.js`**
   - **Purpose**: This file configures Vite, the build tool for your Vue project. It allows you to customize the build process, define path aliases, configure plugins, and set environment variables.
   - **Contents**:
     - `import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'`: This imports the Vite plugin for Vue.js. This plugin allows Vite to process Vue's Single File Components (SFCs), which have .vue extensions.
     - **`plugins`**: This is where you specify any Vite plugins, such as `@vitejs/plugin-vue` for handling Vue SFCs.
     - **`resolve.alias`**: You can define path aliases here to make importing files easier.
     - **`server` and `build` options**: Configure development server settings (like port, proxy, etc.) and build options (like output directory, minification, etc.).
     - The vite.config.js file sets up Vite to handle Vue's SFCs and configures a path alias for easier file imports.
     - The use of defineConfig provides better tooling support.
     - The resolve.alias configuration simplifies imports, allowing you to write @/components/MyComponent.vue instead of a relative path like ../../components/MyComponent.vue.


## install

```
npm install
```
When you run `npm install` after creating a project, two key things happen: the `node_modules` directory is generated, and a `package-lock.json` file is created (or updated if it already exists). Here's what each of these is and why they're important:

### 1. **`node_modules` Folder**
   - **Purpose**: The `node_modules` directory is where npm installs all the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file. This includes both direct dependencies (like Vue) and indirect dependencies (those required by your direct dependencies).
   - **Contents**:
     - The folder contains all the packages your project depends on, along with their dependencies, and so on, creating a nested structure of packages.
     - Each package in `node_modules` is a self-contained folder, with its own `package.json`, code, and sometimes additional dependencies.
   - **Usage**:
     - When you run or build your project, the required packages are loaded from `node_modules`.
     - The presence of this folder allows your project to function correctly, as all the code and modules needed by your application are accessible.

### 2. **`package-lock.json` File**
   - **Purpose**: The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm to lock the specific versions of the dependencies your project is using. This ensures that everyone working on the project (or deploying it) has the exact same dependency versions installed.
   - **Contents**:
     - It contains a detailed tree of all the dependencies and their exact versions, including nested dependencies, as well as the resolved URLs where npm fetched them from.
     - It also includes metadata like the integrity hashes for verifying the integrity of each package.
   - **Usage**:
     - When `npm install` is run, npm uses `package-lock.json` to determine the exact version of each dependency to install.
     - This file is essential for reproducible builds, meaning that your project will behave the same way across different environments, which is crucial for consistency and debugging.
   - **Version Control**:
     - The `package-lock.json` file should be committed to your version control system (e.g., Git). This helps ensure that all collaborators and deployment environments use the same dependency versions.

### Summary
- **`node_modules`**: A directory that contains all the installed packages and their dependencies, enabling your project to run as intended.
- **`package-lock.json`**: A file that locks the versions of your dependencies, ensuring that your project remains consistent and reliable across different environments.

Both `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` are integral to managing and maintaining the stability of your project's dependencies.
